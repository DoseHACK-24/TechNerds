# 🚗 Warehouse Autobot Navigation System

Welcome to the **Warehouse Autobot Navigation System**! 🚀 In this project, we guide autobots through a grid, helping them avoid obstacles and, more importantly, each other. Think of it as the ultimate traffic control system for robots! 🤖🚦

## 🧐 Problem Overview

Dosepacker Inc. (imaginary warehouse overlord) has been struggling with autobots getting stuck and crashing into each other. Not good for business! So, we’re here to building a system that navigates these bots safely and efficiently.

### Key Challenges:
- **Avoid Collisions**: No autobot shall collide! 🚫🤖🤖
- **Dynamic Movement**: Autobots must follow simple commands like `Forward()`, `Left()`, `Right()`, and `Wait()`. 
- **Obstacle Navigation**: We’ve got walls, boxes, and other obstacles to avoid (all marked as `X`).
- **No Deadlocks**: Don't let them get stuck like a 4-way stop sign! 🚧
